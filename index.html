    <h2>Triangle definition</h2>
    <p>A <strong>triangle</strong> is a shape that is made up of three lines and three angles.</p>

    <h3>Equilateral triangle</h3>
    <p>An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal in length. Its three angles are also equal and they are each 60Â°. An equilateral triangle is also an equiangular triangle since all its angles are equal.</p>

    <h3>Isosceles triangle</h3>
    <p>An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length. The angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.</p>

    <h3>Scalene triangle</h3>
    <p>A scalene triangle has no sides of equal length. Its angles are also all different in size.</p>

    <h3>Undefinite Triange</h3>
    <p>The sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values.</p>
